# Things you already know - or so you think
## Challenge
> If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves.
> ~ Thomas Edison

We can say that with each person there are two different lives: the one such a person lives and the one that he/she could have lived if their full potential would be used. The problem is - how to be the most optimal version of oneself? how to make those two lives as close to each other as possible?  That is the challenge that this book is about.

People say: *Knowledge is Power* - but that isn't really true, you can how all the knowledge in the world and did nothing with it. What is true however is that you can use knowledge to do powerful things.What really matters is how you use the information you're given.

The same goes with bad habits, you usually are aware of the process of how to get out of a bad habit, meaning - you know what to do - you just don't do it. If you're overweight, you should probably be careful about what you eat and to be more active - hit the gym or go running, swimming, cycling, etc. The problem isn't the lack of knowledge, the problem is lack of ACTION.

## Redefining a year
The problem to a lot of people is the time period for which we define goals. Which is usually a year. What is wrong with that? Basically for a lot of time you may think to yourself that you still have a lot of time, and when you don't have a lot of time, you start to think: *I won't make it either way*. So you end up less motivated.

We have to remember that action - is a thing that happen during a day or a week - not a year. So we should think about that accordingly. We should focus on really small amounts of time to plan ahead. We shouldn't think about where we want to be in a 5 years, really we should plan what we do in next month.

What is positive about setting up goals with a final deadline (31 of December) is that a lot more is happening near the end of the year. Everyone is working extra hard to meet goals they have set earlier, it really motivates a lot of people. What we can do in this situation is to keep the motivation given by the deadline, but make it happen several times a year. By redefining a "year" to be 12 weeks long. Here be "week" I mean the period for which we set goals and do the summaries and so on.

### Periodization
>We are what we repeatedly doâ€¦ therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit.
>~ Aristotle

by setting our long term goals for a period of 12 weeks we have to think about our progress day by day. This isn't such a long time to be thinking that we still have time to do something. Also appropriate planning can help us be on the right track all the time, or at least be aware if we are on the right track.

Also similarly to end of year break you should do some rest at the end of 12 week year period. That can be some longer weekend, or even entire week. Bottom line is: you have to have some time to have a nothing to think about only reflect on the period that just passed.

## Emotional bond
When you have a strategy that involves hard and difficult activities short term costs can overshadow long term benefits coming from achieving the goal. This effect causes a lot of people to resign from both goals or strategies that they decided to follow. That often happens if we don't have a strong desire to achieve a goal.

It turns out it is crucial for you to build you vision for the future, keep imagine yourself living the life when you achieve some goal, let it motivate you. If you keep that desire strong, when things go hard and difficult (and they will) you will think what drives you to do what you're doing and you'll keep doing it.

Your brain is a funny machine, it has a lot of complex parts that are responsible for different things. There are two of them that should know about regarding thinking about the future.
- Amygdala - detects danger and if you steer your thought into unknown future, it tries to terminate that thought
- Prefrontal cortex - it increases its activity whenever you think about positive future ideas and it overcomes amygdala action.

As you might have guessed, in this scenario Amygdala is your enemy and prefrontal cortex is you friend (oversimplifying a lot - but you get it). What is great about a brain is that you can train it and you can physically affect how different parts of you brain behave. It is called neuroplasticity. Basically if you think about about you future life as a positive thought you'll get your prefrontal cortex to grow and you'll train your neurons to fire better whenever you are actually doing any action that can get you closer to said goal.
