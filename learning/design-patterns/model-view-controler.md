# Model View Controller (original meaning)

> **Model** is an object that understand the mental model of the user. The way the data in the system will be transformed according to that model

> **View** understands how to represent the data in the Model in a way it was intuitive for the user to see

> **Controller** understands how to take the gestures of the users and convert them into commands against the Model


Controller would push commands to the model and View would observe any change in the model to reflect it.
