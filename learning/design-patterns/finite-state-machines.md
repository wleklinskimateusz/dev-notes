# Finite State Machines and The State Pattern

## State Machines
> Finite State machine is a system that can be in limited number of states.

For example if a machine has 3 bits we can have 8 states

If we were to calculate how many programs we could write on 3 bit machine, given that a program is a set of transitions between different states, that number would be greater then 10,000

For each transition we can invoke an action along with that transition

The FSM  can be thought of as a magic black box which accepts input events and produces actions as outputs
